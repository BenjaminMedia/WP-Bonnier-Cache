# Cache handling for Bonnier WordPress sites
This plugin adds the possibility to reach out to all external caching services to update/delete pages, with one call.

- Install the plugin
- Run `composer install` to add dependencies
- Activate the plugin
- Go to the settings page and add the host url for the Cache Microservice.

That's it! The plugin will call the microservice when content is updated or deleted from WordPress.
